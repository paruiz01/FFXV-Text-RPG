== A MENACE SLEEPS IN KEFORGDA ==  
Prince Noctis and his friends spent the night camping out in the wild.  
When they woke up, they noticed that their chocobos were stolen!  
They followed a trail of their footsteps that led to the entrance of Keforgda Dungeon.  
They heard a faint "Kweeeh!" call out from the depths...  
Noctis decides to bring one ally with him while the others watch over the camp.
